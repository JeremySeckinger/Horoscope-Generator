# Horoscope Generator

This is a simple horoscope generator using html, css, and vanilla javascript. Here I am manipulating the DOM using an event listener to input the date on click into a function that determines the output to the DOM based on the month and day specifically. The user simply enters the day and month they were born, and receives their horoscope from the generator. 
Instead of using separate day and month dropdown inputs I wanted to figure out how to allow a date input to take in the month and day while ignoring the year. From research it seems more advanced methods using jquery can allow that, but without complicating the script I found a simpler method to make the year fixed to current. this way the user can only enter the day and year to get their horoscope traits--making input errors impossible, and keeping the code concise. The year is not fixed either, so it will continue functioning as years change.
